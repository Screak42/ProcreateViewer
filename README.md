# ProcreatePreview
QuickLook plugin for mac that allows you to see full previews of .procreate files in Finder.

This is a bit of a weird mish-mash of Python and Objective-C at the moment. Most of the actual .procreate file logic is written in Python and is located in the ProcreatePython folder.

This code is provided mostly for reference, you can download a working installer for mac [here](http://jaromvogel.com/ProcreatePreview)
